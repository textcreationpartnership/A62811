            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36562:2"/>and even ready to ſeize upon Church and State, Wee have been forced yet once againe in the diſcharge of our Conſciences, to take the humble boldneſſe to poure forth into your boſomes the ſorrows of our hearts, and to preſent unto your Honours the conceived cauſes of our Miſeries; truſting, that in your grave wiſdomes you will both ſee into them, and in your Juſtice give remedy againſt them: For who can ſee Religion, Lawes, Liberties, (things of ſo great and precious concernment) not onely aſſaulted, but even overwhelmed, and the Unity, Peace, and Proſperity of the Kingdomes violated, and almoſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by a treacherous and cowardly ſilence continue to hold his peace? Wee cannot, wee dare not, the oath of God with a curſe lyes upon us, if wee ſhall ſo baſely yeeld to a Spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency and neutrality, in a Cauſe which doth ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Gods glory, and the Kingdomes good, and ſhall not (eſpecially in ſuch a time as this) zealouſly and conſtantly in our places and callings, according to our power, apply our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt endeavours, notwithſtanding all lets and oppoſitions, to promote the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot but bee acknowledged, moſt worthy Senators, that the Churches of God in times of Reformation, have ever thought it the fitteſt ſeaſon of all others, in ſome extraordinary manner to oblige themſelves unto Almighty God, as the Divine goodneſſe hath put it into your hearts (according to the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practiſe, upon all occaſions, of the moſt godly and religious Governours) to ſtrike a ſolemne Covenant with him, and by your Authority to enjoyne the ſame to the Kingdomes, for the reformation and defence of Religion, Lawes, Liberties, as an excellent meanes to acquire the favour of God, and the uniting and ſtrengthening of the three Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt the common enemies of the true reformed Religion, peace and proſperity of the Kingdomes, to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manifeſtation of your moſt Chriſtian zeale and piety to God and to his truth: Wherefore we cannot here but make our ſad complaint unto your Honors, in the expreſſion of our deepeſt ſenſe of that great diſhonour which is done unto the heavenly Majeſty in the moſt horrible ſlighting and treacherous infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36562:2"/>of this moſt ſacred Oath, and that bold contempt which is offered at this day to the authority of this renowned Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this their ſo religious undertaking and injunction, on the one part by thoſe that altogether refuſe to enter into this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Covenant of God and the Kingdomes, and on the other part by them which declaime againſt it, and caſt diſgracefull aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon it; that wee can not looke at theſe perſons (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their pretences bee) as any other then either malignant Enemies to the Parliament, or the Peace and Union of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and the reformation of Religion; nor can we promiſe to our ſelves any ſecurity, ſo long as they are ſuffered undiſcovered, or unpuniſhed, to live among us. Wee therefore make it our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayer unto your Honors, that you would bee pleaſed (as in your pious wiſedome you ſhall thinke moſt fit) to find out and appoint ſuch wayes or meanes, to diſcover and bring ſo great miſdoers and offenders againſt God and your Authority to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment, as may be moſt agreeable to the merit of their ſo crying offences; and that as you have long ſince enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Ordinance of Parliament the taking of this ſacred Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, (which notwithſtanding is not yet done in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Kingdome) ſo you would countenance and defend it inviolable from neglect, infringement, ſcorne, and defamation, and by your Civill ſanction effectually impoſe it to bee ſworne by all without exception, under ſome certaine penalty, as beſt ſhall ſeeme unto your Honours, to bee duly inflicted by your religious Juſtice upon the wilfull contemners of the ſame. And here give us leave in all humility to offer what ſeems to us both juſt and neceſſary, That ſuch perſons as have not taken, and ſhall not take the ſolemne League and Covenant, or having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, are manifeſtly diſaffected to the ends therein expreſſed, eſpecially in point of Religion, may not bee countenanced, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in, or advanced to places of publike Truſt, as being a diſcredit to your Government, dangerous to the Kingdomes, and a hinderance to the reformation of Religion. By ſo doing you ſhall preſerve this great Oath of our God from contempt and violation, a ſin, which wee humbly conceive is the chiefeſt cauſe of moſt of thoſe miſeries and calamities that Gods juſt hand hath brought upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36562:3"/>II. When you did at firſt conclude upon that ſacred Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (wherein now you have ſolemnly engaged both your ſelves and us) how glad were the hearts of all the faithfull in the Land, and what rejoycing was there at the Oath, as in the dayes of <hi>Aſa?</hi> Wee hoped then that our Religion (more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then our lives, which was that the truly godly had chiefly in their eye) had beene ſo ſecured, that all the malice, power, and policy both of men and devills ſhould never have beene able to overturne the ſame; But with bleeding hearts we ſpeak it, how is it, that for all this, ſuch an inundation of Errors, Schiſms, Hereſies is broken in upon us, which if not ſpeedily prevented by your Wiſdomes, and oppoſed by your impartiall Juſtice, wee feare will have its dreadfull effect to the totall ſubverſion of the power of godlineſſe. Wee are even ſtrucke with ſuch aſtoniſhment that after ſuch a Covenant, there ſhould ſuch blaſphemies bee uttered to Gods higheſt dishonour; that ſuch hereticall opinions ſhould bee broached, to the never ſo much vilifying of the truth; that ſuch Schiſmes ſhould bee acted and fomented, to the renting and dividing of the Church; that the Government eſtabliſhed ſhould bee ſo much defamed, and oppoſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Parliament, in words, in bookes, in practiſe, by the Sectaries of theſe times, who yet ſeeme as men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſanctuary, finding nothing done unto them, for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of theſe miſchiefes, or the puniſhment of theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. God hath done great things for us, and hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us great Salvation as at this day, then woe bee to us if theſe bee our returnes for ſo great bleſſings. Truſty and Right Worthy Patriots, wee know not whither to goe in theſe our ſad diſtempers, but unto you whom God and this Kingdome hath betruſted with what is moſt pretious unto him, and deareſt unto us, the protection of Religion, the preſerving of it in Doctrine pure, and in diſcipline from contempt and ſcorne, is that for which above all things elſe wee beſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:36562:3"/>thinke wee can never ſay enough for our God, and for his Truth: What are our eſtates, our liberties, our lives unto us, if the Arke of God bee taken? if that bee gone, the glory, yea, the life of our lives is departed from <hi>England.</hi> Wee tremble to thinke, if a remedy bee not ſuddenly applyed, what will bee the iſſue of theſe things. Wherefore our humble deſires are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your Honours, That you would bee pleaſed to give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſuppreſſe all ſuch from publike Preaching, as have not duely been Ordained, whereby their gifts for the Miniſtery, and their ſoundneſſe in the Faith might be evinced: As alſo, ſeparate Congregations, the very nurſeries of all damnable Hereſies: That an Ordinance be made for ſome exemplary puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon Heretiques and Schiſmaticks, that your utter diſlike of them and their proceedings may be manifeſt to all the world, which had been made long ſince to appeare by a well-ſetled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, had not his Majeſty denyed his conſent to the Bill for the Aſſembly, ſo often preſented to him by both Houſes, according to your own Declaration in anſwer to his Majeſties of the 23 of <hi>October,</hi> 1642.</p>
            <p>And that all Godly and Orthodox Miniſters who labour in Gods husbandry, may have encouragement, ſome courſe being thought upon in your wiſedomes for their competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the Lord having ſo ordained that they which preach the Goſpell, ſhould live of the Goſpel: ſo ſhall Religion flouriſh, the wrath of God be averted, the lips of the juſt ſhall bleſſe you, and a gracious recompence of reward from Gods moſt bounteous hand ſhall ſurely waite upon you.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as the welfare and ſafety of this Kingdome doth next under God in the preſervation of true Religion, depend upon the fundamentall Conſtitutions of the ſame, and the maintenance thereof, which fundamentall Conſtitutions do moſt eminently appeare in the calling of that great Councell the Parliament, and in electing of Members for the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt conſpicuouſly doth ſhine the Liberty and Property of the Subject, here wee can doe no leſſe, then make it our hearty prayer unto your Honours, that you would be pleaſed to give ſtrict order, that writs for a free election without delay may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36562:4"/>be iſſued to all places, where Knights and Burgeſſes for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are yet to be choſen; and to provide that the people bee not prejudiced in their free choice, either by force, feare, letters, promiſes, or ſollicitations of any: that the Subjects liberties being defended and preſerved, they may be encouraged and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to ſerve your Honours and the Publike.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And here we not omit to hint unto your Honours, the exorbitant practices of many Committees and Committee men, who have ſuch an influence by meanes of their Authority upon the people, they being at their wills, and in their power to doe them a diſpleaſure, that they dare not do otherwiſe then obey their unlawfull Commands, without the inevitable hazard of their peace and ſafety; through which meanes tyranny is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by one fellow ſubject upon another, and juſtice and equity cannot enter: The cries of all ſorts of people throughout the land are growne ſo loud againſt the people of this vocation and profeſſion, by reaſon of thoſe grievous oppreſſions that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acted by them, that in tenderneſſe of affection towards our brethren, not being ignorant or inſenſible of our owne ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in this kinde, and the great diſhonour accruing to the Parliament thereby, that we cannot but be earneſt ſuitors to your mercy and juſtice that ſuch may be diſſolved.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The God of your ſalvation through the timous helpe of his willing people hath now expelled your adverſaries, and brought us ſate through the Red-ſea of our feares and troubles, to the borders of that ſweet <hi>Canaan</hi> of our deſired peace; and what now remaines, moſt worthy Patriots, but that in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God for his mercy, and in grateful acknowledgement of the loving affections of his people in their ſo cheerefull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in the Cauſe of God and the Kingdome, but that the heavy yoakes ſhould be looſed, to which they ſo readily did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their necks, nay deſired you to put upon them for your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and the Kingdomes weale? Which therefore is our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble requeſt, that the enemies being now ſubdued, the Armies may be disbanded, that the ſo much complained of oppreſſions by their meanes may be redreſſed, and taxes for their ſupport may be releaſed, and the Militia of the Kingdome ſettled: ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36562:4"/>ſhall you make it appeare to the ſhame of ſlanderous tongues, that this warre hath not beene intended as a trade, but as a meanes of regaining our loſt peace, and that you had no other deſigne in proſecution of the ſame, then the ſecuring of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Lawes and Liberties, ſo deſperately invaded by tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call oppreſſors; and ſhall indeare the affections of this people to you for your future aſſiſtance, when in a time of need their helpe ſhall be required, and they will become yours and the Kingdomes ſervants for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And now ſince God hath holpen us in our diſtreſſe, in will not be unacceptable ſervice unto him, that we ſhould put forth the bowells of our Compaſſions to our diſtreſſed brethren, as being the moſt kindely fruits of Gods mercifull dealing with our ſelves; And what an object is <hi>Ireland</hi> for this purpoſe? Moſt noble Senators, ſinoe God hath ſhewen you mercy, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing your enemies here, let us be your earneſt Petitioners for gaſping, dying <hi>Ireland,</hi> in this their great extremity: for in thoughts of their calamities our bowells are rowled within us; never did their neceſſities call lowder to your mercy then now they doe.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. And certainely one ſingular meanes to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

Therefore we returne againe unto your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that according to our Covenant, condigne puniſhment may be inflicted upon ſuch firebrands, the greateſt enemies to Church and State, and that your Honours would readily apply all tendreſt care in your moſt faithfull and diligent endeavours for the preſervation of that happy union by ſolemne League of theſe two Kingdomes, which is ſo much the envie of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the ſtrength and glory of Great Britaine, and the greateſt ſecurity of our Religion, peace and proſperity.</p>

And whereas the hand of the Almighty hath ſo eminently appeared on your ſide, that your enemies are falne under you, and hath given the troublers of yours and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes peace into your hands: Wee doe beſeech that according to the ſeverall qualities of their Delinquencies, your Iuſtice may goe forth againſt them with ſpeedy execution. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that now you would bee ſo mindefull of your great ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the full and effectuall diſcharge of the Kingdomes debts (who have ſhewed themſelves ſuch free Contributers, and alſo have been ſuch extreme ſufferers for your aſſiſtance in the Kingdomes cauſe) as to provide that a faithfull improvement of the eſtates of theſe notorious enemies of the Kingdome may be made by a right converſion of them unto publick uſe. And that thoſe ſtreams of wealth, which daily are flowing in by Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Delinquents, may according to your ſolemne promiſes runne in the right channell, and returne back into that Ocean whence at your deſire they did ſo freely iſſue forth.</p>
            <p>And whereas in your Wiſdomes, your Honours have made ſo good proviſion, that men of eſtates and fortunes in the world, may bee repayed their disburſements upon the loane of ſo much more, as in your Ordinance for the ſale of Biſhops Lands doth more fully appeare: Wee doe intreat that you would pleaſe to take into your further conſideration thoſe well-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſo freely and fully laid out themſelves, as that they have not been able to make that addition required in the aforeſaid Ordinance, but muſt now be forced for the relief of their great neceſſities, to ſell at great loſſe, their very principal lent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick Faith, to their great diſcouragement and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which wee feare may prove no ſmall impediment to your future aſſiſtance, if need thereof ſhould be, unleſſe remedy herein ſhall by your Honours be provided.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. And for protections wee neede ſay little, ſo much having beene ſaid before in our Remonſtrance, that wee hope your Honours are ſo ſenſible of the ſufferings of thoſe Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who have great ſummes of money owing by ſome of your Members, and of the injuſtice of thoſe among them, that have Eſtates to ſatisfie their ingagements, yet will not, but ſtand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36562:5"/>upon their priviledge, as there needs no other argument to move your Honours to doe us juſtice in this behalfe.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And becauſe wee are obliged to indeavour the preſervation of the Liberties of the Kingdome, therefore that wee may performe our engagements as to God and you, ſo likewiſe to the Subjects of the Kingdome, whoſe ſufferings in matters that concerne their Rights are our owne; wee hold our ſelves bound, in all humility, to ſignifie unto your Honours, that contrary to the Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, on Friday evening the 4. of this inſtant moneth, there was an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Warrant, ſigned by Sir <hi>William Strickland,</hi> ſerved upon three of our fellow Subjects, and fellow Citizens, by name <hi>Patrick Bamford, Nicholas Widmerpoole, Valentine Fyge,</hi> to bee taken into cuſtody and committed to a Serjeant at Armes; which thing was alſo done contrary to the Order of that Honourable Houſe, as by ſome of the Committee themſelves was acknowledged. Wherefore wee doe humbly pray, that the aforeſaid Warrant with the manner of its iſſuing forth, may bee taken into your ſerious conſideration for the vindication of the Honour of the Parliament, which is herein ſo much concerned, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Subjects Liberty, and to make ſuch reparations to the perſons wronged as may ſtand with juſtice, and in your wiſedomes ſhall ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now renowned Worthies, wee truſt that in your wonted goodneſſe, you will not entertaine any miſconceptions of us, for that wee have endeavoured to bee a little more patheticke and preſſing in our phraſe of ſpeech then heretofore; but that in your wiſedomes you will throughly weigh our feares and ſorrows with our preſſing burdens, which have even forced us as againſt our wills to theſe expreſſions; and that looking upon the ſincere affections of your Petitioners you will pleaſe to make ſo benigue an interpretation of what wee have here repreſented in the urgency of our afflicted ſpirits, as not to thinke wee had the leaſt aime to reflect upon the Honour of this famous Parliament: but that the ſenſe of our miſeries in our approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching dangers might ſtand more conſpicuouſly before your eyes, and as by the moſt forcible argument wee could thinke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36562:6"/>upon, effectually to move your Honours (the great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of our Church and State) to apply your moſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſpeedy helpe. The Glory of God, the ſafety of our Religion and Liberties, and the Kingdomes welfare, is that wee levell at in this our undertaking, If through your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptation of theſe our humble addreſſes wee may obtaine the ſecurity of theſe, wee have our utmoſt aime; And you ſhall bee called the Repairers of the breaches, the Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of paths to dwell in, you ſhall raiſe monuments of your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall praiſes, the Churches of God ſhall call you bleſſed, and you ſhall for ever engage us not to thinke our eſtates or lives too deare to ſerve your Honours and the Publique ſo long as wee have breath and being.</p>
